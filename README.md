# VortexLoaderV2 coming soon

# Vortex | A C# simple cheat loader
Vortex is a C# loader for people who can't code one.
### I did not test the loader if you face any errors contact me or ask for help on the discord server
and dont mind the 40+ commits im just testing sum stuff

### For anyone saying that this loader is pasted just check how different the code is. I already credited anyone i took anything from and for anyone thinking that settings.cs is pasted i didnt even know roshly organizes strings in that way.
